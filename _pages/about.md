Hi! I'm Simon, and I've moved to London recently. I'm a Data Scientist, these days but I have a long history in electricity markets and analysis back in Australia, and an education in advanced mathematics (first class honours).

This is my blog/portfolio website - I'll update here periodically with posts on personal projects I'm working on. Feel free to reach out and connect - details on my [contact](../contact) page!

When I'm not data sciencing, I'm playing guitar, tennis, video and board games, snowboarding and going to the gym.
